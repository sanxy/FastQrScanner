# Privacy Policy
This privacy policy is designed to provide transparency to your use of SanxyNet application Fast QR Scanner for Android devices. 
This android application allows users to write and manage notes.
I built the Fast QR Scanner app as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by Yusuf Adefolahan at no cost and is intended for use as it is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Unique Note unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Email address. The information that I request is retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way

## Advertising
Fast QR Scanner app may display banner ads served by AdMob. 
Advertising helps us to keep our app free for you to use. 
Ads won’t be displayed after purchasing “Premium” in-app product.

AdMob is an advertising service provided by AdMob Google Inc. 
AdMob may use and collect anonymous data about your interests to customize advertising in our app. To do that AdMob uses unique 
user-resettable Advertising ID, provided by Google Play services. Advertising ID enables users to reset their identifier 
or opt out of personalized ads (interest-based ads) within Google Play apps (including our app).

In order to understand Google’s use of Data, consult Google’s partner policy.

Opt out of seeing personalized ads

It is possible to opt out of interest-based advertising on your Android device.

Open the “Settings” application on your Android device and select the “Google” menu item. Depending on your device, this option 
may not be visible on the main menu but you may use the search function at the top of the Settings menu to find it. From there, 
select the “Ads” sub-item and activate the option “Opt out of Ads Personalisation” to prevent the creation of profiles and the 
display of personalized advertising. You can delete the advertising ID in the same menu at any time (“Reset advertising ID”), 
then a new ID will be created which will not be merged with the previously collected data.

Please note that if you choose to “opt out” it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just means that 
the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant to you.
